# Mainframe-Job-Automation-Tool

Objective:
Develop a Java-based application that allows users to submit JCL jobs, retrieve their output, and monitor job execution status on a mainframe server.


### Features:

1. Job Submission:

Allow users to upload or create JCL scripts in the Java application.

Submit the JCL to the mainframe server via a network connection.



2. Job Monitoring:

Track the status of submitted jobs (e.g., RUNNING, COMPLETED, FAILED).

Fetch and display job execution logs (e.g., SYSOUT, SYSERR).



3. Job Output Retrieval:

Retrieve and display output files generated by the JCL job.

Save the outputs locally on the user’s machine.



4. Security:

Authenticate users with mainframe credentials.

Ensure encrypted communication with the mainframe server.



5. Integration:

Use libraries like IBM’s JZOS Toolkit or SSH for mainframe communication.



### Technology Stack:

1. Java Components:

Core Java: For application logic and file handling.

Swing/JavaFX: For a GUI-based application.

JDBC: If the application needs to interact with mainframe databases like DB2.



2. Mainframe Communication:

IBM JZOS Toolkit: Allows Java programs to interact with z/OS.

SSH: To connect and execute commands on the mainframe.

RACF Authentication: For user security.



3. Mainframe Elements:

JCL: Scripts to execute batch jobs.

z/OS: Mainframe operating system.




### Implementation Steps:

1. Setup Mainframe Connectivity:

Establish a secure connection to the mainframe server (e.g., via SSH or FTP).

Authenticate using valid credentials (e.g., RACF user ID and password).


2. Create JCL Submission Module:

Allow users to input JCL scripts or upload existing ones.

Transfer JCL to the mainframe using FTP or an equivalent protocol.

Submit the JCL for execution (e.g., using the SUBMIT command).


3. Monitor Job Execution:

Poll the mainframe for the job's status using tools like SDSF commands or APIs.

Parse the response to determine the job's status.


4. Fetch Job Outputs:

Retrieve output datasets (e.g., SYSOUT, SYSERR) from the mainframe.

Display the outputs in the application or save them as files.


5. Develop the Application Interface:

Design a user-friendly GUI for job submission, monitoring, and output retrieval.

Use JavaFX or Swing to build the front-end.
